# logisim_origin

This is a copy of the last stable version 2.7.1 of the original logisim before the author Carl Burch stopped the development around 2014. (ref to: http://www.cburch.com/logisim/)
I am very into the origin of great ideas/projects. With very minor change now it runs on my box (mac 11.6.1) with jdk17. Enjoy it!
